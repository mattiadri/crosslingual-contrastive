\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we investigated multilingual vision--language representation learning through an image-pivoted contrastive framework, where images serve as language-agnostic anchors and no parallel text is used during training. By restricting learning to a lightweight text-side projection head (primarily a residual linear mapping) and leveraging visual grounding as the sole cross-lingual signal, we were able to isolate and study how multilingual alignment emerges in CLIP-style models.

Our experiments show that image-pivoted alignment consistently improves multilingual image--text retrieval across a diverse set of languages, including those with different scripts and resource levels. Importantly, improvements are measured on held-out folds under cross-validation, indicating that the alignment generalizes beyond the training subset used for optimization and is not driven by translation-based supervision or explicit cross-lingual constraints.

Beyond performance, we conducted an in-depth representation analysis to understand the structural effects of multilingual alignment. We showed that alignment manifests as a gradual convergence of representational geometry across languages, characterized by increased cross-lingual similarity, improved isotropy, and healthier feature utilization. At the same time, intrinsic dimensionality is reduced in a controlled manner, suggesting that alignment removes redundant language-specific variation without inducing representational collapse.

Taken together, our findings show that visual grounding alone constitutes a strong supervisory signal for multilingual alignment, and that the nature of the learned alignment depends critically on the capacity of the projection head: linear mappings favor structural convergence, while nonlinear heads favor retrieval performance. They also highlight the importance of going beyond downstream metrics and analyzing representation geometry when studying multilingual multimodal models.

We hope that this work encourages further research into lightweight, interpretable approaches to multilingual alignment, as well as more systematic use of representation-level diagnostics to better understand the behavior and limitations of large multimodal models.
